**Sitter-Specific** means splitting your data into multiple notecards, e.g., \PMposes\ (for sitter 0) and \PMposes 1\ (for sitter 1).

### Pros
*   Organized for massive builds.
*   Less scrolling.

*Note: PoseMagic reads all PMposes* cards and merges them, so you can organize them however you like.*
