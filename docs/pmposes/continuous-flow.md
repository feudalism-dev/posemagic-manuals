**Continuous Flow** is the default way to organize your data. It treats multiple notecards as one single, long stream of data.

### Naming Convention
*   \PMposes\ (First card)
*   \PMposes 1\ (Second card)
*   \PMposes 2\ (Third card)
*   ...and so on.

### How it Works
The system reads \PMposes\. When it reaches the end, it automatically looks for \PMposes 1\ and continues reading as if there was no break.

### Best For
*   Most furniture projects.
*   Simply adding more poses when you run out of space in the first card.
