## How to Contribute

### Reporting Issues

Found an error or have a suggestion? 

1. Check if the issue already exists
2. Create a new issue with:
   - Clear description
   - Steps to reproduce (if applicable)
   - Expected vs actual behavior

### Improving Documentation

1. **Fork the repository**
2. **Create a branch** for your changes
3. **Make your edits** to the markdown files
4. **Test locally** (optional but recommended)
5. **Submit a pull request**

### Writing Guidelines

- **Be clear and direct** - No marketing fluff
- **Use examples** - Show, don't just tell
- **Progressive depth** - Start simple, add complexity
- **Bold labels** - Use bold for list item lead-ins
- **Code blocks** - Use proper syntax highlighting
- **Callouts** - Use Note/Tip/Warning/Danger appropriately

### Local Testing

To test locally:

```bash
cd docs
bundle install
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

Then visit `http://localhost:4000`

### Pull Request Process

1. Keep PRs focused on one topic
2. Update relevant pages if needed
3. Test that links work
4. Ensure markdown renders correctly
5. Add yourself to contributors (if desired)
