The **Anchor** system provides a visual way to adjust sit positions. Instead of clicking X/Y/Z buttons, you can rez a physical "stick" that represents the avatar's position and move it with your build tools.

## Requirements
*   `! PM - setup` (in the main object)
*   `! PM - anchor` (in the object inventory)

## How to Use

1.  **Enter Adjust Mode:** Touch your object and select **[ADJUST]**.
2.  **Rez Helper:** Select **[HELPER]** from the menu.
3.  **Visual Stick:** A glowy stick will appear at the sitter's location.
4.  **Move It:** Right-click and **Edit** the stick. Drag it around using SL build tools.
    *   As you move the stick, the avatar moves with it in real-time.
5.  **Save:** When satisfied, click **[SAVE]** or **[NEW POSE]** in the menu to record the position.

## Why use Anchors?
*   **Precision:** SL build tools are more precise than menu buttons.
*   **Rotation:** Visual rotation is much more intuitive than guessing degrees.
*   **Speed:** You can position a complex group pose in seconds.
